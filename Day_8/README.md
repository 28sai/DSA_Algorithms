# Day 9 - Insertion Sort ✍️

## 💡 Problem  
Sort an array using **Insertion Sort**, best for small or nearly sorted datasets.

## 🧠 Algorithm  
1. Start from index 1 and pick the element.  
2. Compare it with elements to its left.  
3. Shift elements and insert it in the correct place.

## 🚀 Example  
Input: `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6]`  
Output: `[5, 6, 11, 12, 13]`

## 📊 Time Complexity  
- Best: O(n)  
- Worst: O(n²)  
- Space: O(1)  
- Stable: ✅
